        <h4>Promote Open Dialogue:</h4>
        <p>Start implementing regular check-ins with each other. These could be daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on what feels most comfortable. During these conversations, make it a point to share feelings, concerns, and dreams. You might encounter resistance at first, but itâ€™s crucial to remember the goal: greater openness, understanding, and trust.</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Physical Intimacy:</h4>
        <p>Take steps to improve your physical closeness. This could mean holding hands more often, hugging, cuddling while watching a movie, or any activity that makes you both feel physically closer. Given the busy nature of life, especially with kids, this might be challenging, but small gestures can go a long way.</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Family Values:</h4>
        <p>Since you both have different moral beliefs and have been together for a long time with two kids, try to establish common family values. Discuss with her about the core principles you both want to teach your children. This might help you find a common ground in your ethical beliefs, bringing you closer together and reinforcing your family's unity.</p>
